# From Java to Go

Can you imagine Java without the _Class_ data type or Java without the _static_ keyword? It was almost unfathomable to have such
a thought not too long ago. Even the most basic and rudimentary "Hello World" Java application used to require having at least 
a _Class_ and the almighty _public static void main_ method, and of course the hellish-looking _System.out_ abomination. 

I'll keep my Java references to the pre-java-17 era for dramatic effect, where the speed of light use to be only slightly faster 
than the speed of sound, and where most of the enterprise still lives. Without a _Class_ type, the Java world would simply screech
to a halt. It would be like Armageddon where nobody knows what to do next and nobody knows what to expect.

In Go, there is no formal concept of a _Class_ type, or a _static_ method, and this is the first bombshell which a happy-go-lucky, 
hippity-hoppity, Java developer skipping through the Go universe encounters and it is terrifying. There is no _implement_ or 
_extend_ or _abstract_ or _String_. Some other keywords may sound deceptively familiar, like _package_, but the devil is in the 
details, since the implementation philosophy could be vastly different. But fear not. The Go universe does have precious gold 
mines that Java developers can only dream of, like dreaming for a gift from _the real Santa_.
